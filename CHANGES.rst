3.0 (2011-09-28)
----------------

Lizard 3: Make sure you read the readme before upgrading to this version.

- Rebuilt collage screen with grouping.

- Added configchecker.

- Added migration for new models; South introspection rules.

- Integrated search_name in search_coordinates.

- Various functions work on WorkspaceEdits and WorkspaceStorages.

- Added generic dialog javascript code.

- Added generic POST action javascript code.

- Made app_screen class-based, with helper class WorkspaceView.

- Added new workspaces, collages.

- Added PeriodMixin with tests.

- Added all kinds of mixins for workspaces, collages, etc:
  GoogleTrackingMixin, WorkspaceMixin, WorkspaceEditMixin, MapMixin,
  CollageMixin, DateRangeMixin.

- Added class based views: AppView,
  WorkspaceStorageView, HomepageView, CollageDetailView.

- Added class based views for dialogs: ActionDialogView, WorkspaceSaveView,
  WorkspaceLoadView, DateRangeView, CollageItemEditorView,
  WorkspaceStorageListView, CollageView, CollageEmptyView,
  CollageItemEditView, CollagePopupView, WorkspaceEmptyView.

- Adapter stuff: AdapterMixin, ImageMixin, AdapterImageView, AdapterCsvView.


2.5 (2011-09-23)
----------------

- Not mentioning pyproj as a dependency anymore, even though we *do* need
  it. Somehow the osc.recipe.sysegg buildout recipe doesn't really want to
  play nice with it.

- When there's an non-existing adapter (=invalid/non-existing entry point
  name), we now also delete the workspace item instead of raising an
  error. There just might be an old workspace item laying around in a
  customer's session and we shouldn't keep the customer stuck in an
  error 500.


2.4 (2011-09-22)
----------------

- The context processor now first weeds out faulty workspace items before
  attempting anything else. This prevents an "error 500": normally the
  workspace item gets deleted, but the .is_animatable call still breaks on the
  just-deleted workspaceitem. Now we first remove the faulty ones beforehand.


2.3 (2011-09-20)
----------------

- Made the automatic invalid-workspaceitem-deletion more robust.

- Removed the youtube popup. Unused at the moment. And the implementation was
  terribly hardcoded.

- Commented out all the debugging in the symbolmanager


2.2 (2011-09-02)
----------------

- 2.1.13 stated "please clear your session info when you upgrade to this
  version as the fix to #3181 stores different information." This release
  fixes that. No session data deletion is needed anymore.


2.1.13 (2011-09-01)
-------------------

- Fixed a problem in the date range selector, namely that the day of the end
  date with move to the next day when the user selected another month of the
  end date (#3181).

- Added request to templatetag snippet_group to be able to use request in
  adapters' html function.


2.1.12 (2011-08-30)
-------------------

- Added try/except around hotshot in profile middleware, because it
  requires python-profiler.

- Added request to layout_options in popup_collage_json. The request
  is needed in some adapter.html functions in order to get user
  datetime/periods.


2.1.11 (2011-08-30)
-------------------

- Fixed progress cursor in popup_click_handler().

- Zoom to closest extent is no longer used for workspace items.


2.1.10 (2011-08-24)
-------------------

- Requiring lizard-ui 3.0 now, which also means Django 1.3. Updated the
  buildout and the testsettings for that. We're also using the KGS (known good
  set) now to limit the amount of version pinning.


2.1.9 (2011-08-16)
------------------

- Edited mouse progress on click in map.


2.1.8 (2011-08-05)
------------------

- Added function to list icons names.


2.1.7 (2011-08-04)
------------------

- Fixed background-map wms. Updated template and js.

- Changed font-size for long legend texts in adapter.py. #3095.

- Added pdf.png icon. Use pdf.png as mask as well with color ffffff.

- Changed breadcrumbs according to #2499. The behaviour is as follows:
  home for home screen and home -> screen for other screens.

- Fixed clicking bug in FF5: set pixelTolerance to null instead if 0
  is a workaround for the OpenLayers bug. #3108.


2.1.6 (2011-07-29)
------------------

- Added function to convert WGS84 coordinates to RD.

- Updated point_3.png: the upper left corner contained an error.

- Added truncation of workspace-item-names to 80 characters (the
  server would otherwise crash on longer names).

- Now using QuerySet.count instead of len(QuerySet.all()) in workspace
  manager.

- Added some rel=tipsy html parameters.

- Pinned lizard_ui to 2.1.4


2.1.5 (2011-07-25)
------------------

- Settings are now cached. After deleting and saving the cache will be
  invalidated.

- Added setting option javascript_hover_handler. Setting this option
  to 'popup_hover_handler' will enable mouse overs. Note: run a
  migrate after upgrading, the Setting.key field can now be 40
  characters.

- #3096: fixed blue info button in workspace-acceptables (they appear
   in lizard-shape).


2.1.4 (2011-07-14)
------------------

- iPad update: the (+) works again as well as some trees on the
  sidebar. #3003, #3004.


2.1.3 (2011-07-12)
------------------

- Removed draggability of workspace-acceptables.

- Made the adapter.extent function optional. In
  WorkspaceItem.has_extent we now just detect if the function is at
  all present.  #3041, #3036.

- Added wms layers to transparency function. #3039.

- Updated googlemaps_api_keys in fixture: the new key is for
  lizardsystem.nl and all its subdomains.

- Updated workspace_item_empty: When emptying workspace, the
  snippet-groups will also be deleted. #3031.

- Added try/except around search_coordinates and search_name for
  #3033.


2.1.2 (2011-06-30)
------------------

- Adapter.legend: removed "force_legend_below" behaviour when width <
  500. TODO: fix force_legend_below or remove.

- Changed adapter.legend: self.axes.legend instead of
  self.figure.legend. Everything seems ok.


2.1.1 (2011-06-30)
------------------

- Added google_tracking_code from settings to context_processor, if
  available.

- Added try/except in WorkspaceCollageSnippetGroup.values_table (used
  in "show tables" of collage view), because some adapters don't
  implement the adapter.values function.


2.1 (2011-06-29)
----------------

- Temporary disable sorting in workspace when a new workspace-item is
  being added. Solves #2961.

-----------------

1.87 (2011-06-17)
-----------------

- Re-enabled custom y tick locator amount selection.

- Showing the table now looks at the table belonging to the button by means of
  a wrapper div, which is more reliable.

- Fixed the problem that a hidden popup would remain populated and re-evaluated
  (ticket 2892).


1.86 (2011-06-16)
-----------------

- Added bare try/except around wms workspace layer looping to prevent
  the function to crash.

- Added transparency_slider to context variables. From now on the
  transparency_slider is enabled by default.

- Added optional popup_video_url parameter to the ``homepage()`` view.  This
  video url, when used, should point to the embed urls of YouTube videos.
  Currently the sizes are hardcoded, so this is work-in-progress.
  The video is shown once per day, max.

- Modified graph: less yticks, bigger ylabel, dutch monthnames,
  yearlabel is now at first tick of year.


1.85 (2011-06-10)
-----------------

- Added default "javascript_click_handler" (namely ``popup_click_handler``) to
  the context via the lizard_map context processor.

- Fixed bug where graph edit form would fail always unless you switched on
  summaries per *month*.


1.16 (2010-09-28)
-----------------

- Added option: allow_custom_legend in adapter.

- Added optional transparency slider.

- Fixed bug in graph edit and graph line edit popup forms.


1.15 (2010-09-27)
-----------------

- Fixed IE bug that most workspace-related icons floated one line down.


1.14 (2010-09-27)
-----------------

- Fixed bug in filter-on-month handling.

- Using newer lizard-ui with better print icon handling.

- Using color widget for legend customization.


1.13 (2010-09-22)
-----------------

- Bugfix data attributes lizard-map-wms. Moved divs from above-content
  to content.


1.12 (2010-09-22)
-----------------

- Make 'now' line orange.


1.11 (2010-09-20)
-----------------

- Added more tests (test coverage now at 62%).

- Various UI and javascript fixes.

- Showing aggregation period data in the statistics table.

- Moved javascript out of map template into a separate javascript file: this
  way the javascript can be tested automatically (and it is!).

- "Sleep items hierheen" and "Nog geen grafieken" are not draggable anymore.

- Add restrict-to-month option.

- Percentile in collage screen is now user adjustable.

- Move legend code to template tag. Add custom legend modification possibility.


1.10 (2010-09-08)
-----------------

- Add never_cache to several server requests, to prevent caching in IE.

- Fixed graph popup rendering problem for IE7 (empty <a> tags get hidden
  there, even if there's an icon background).


1.9 (2010-09-03)
----------------

- Use updated krw shapefiile.

- Use different open street map.


1.8 (2010-08-30)
----------------

- Bugfix for when no statistics are available.


1.7 (2010-08-27)
----------------

- Graph and collage popups now use the "regular" jquerytools popup instead of
  the OpenLayers in-the-map popup.  Visually cleaner, clearer and prettier.
  And easier to maintain and to get right.

- Various visual fixes.

- Deleting a workspace item also deletes the corresponding snippets.

- Added color pulldown for collage view settings (instead of requiring you to
  know the internal matplotlib color code names :-) )


1.6 (2010-08-26)
----------------

- Animation slider and name-hover are now also working in the default
  workspace view.

- Name hover is now placed just to the lower right of the cursor.  This way
  you can still click on the item you hovered above instead of your click
  being blocked sometimes by the hovering name.

- Added slightly more whitespace to the right of legend-less graphs: this
  prevents (most) labels from being cut off.


1.5 (2010-08-26)
----------------

- Added tooltips with name when hovering over clickable map items.

- Layout improvements for popups and tables.

- Added dateperiods: calculate periods for use in graphs.

- Added styling for popups.


1.4 (2010-08-23)
----------------

- WorkspaceCollageSnippetGroup's name was a TextField (=multiline) instead of
  a simple CharField.  Oracle stores a TextField as a "NCLOB" and has some
  restrictions on them (no index, no .distinct()).  Anyway, this blew up on
  an oracle-using installation.  Fixed now.

- Removed double value_aggregate() method from base adapter: the extra one
  raised a NotImplemented error and overshadowed the real method.


1.3 (2010-08-18)
----------------

- Requiring our dependencies that must be installed with system eggs.  We use
  the osc.recipe.sysegg in our own buildout to grab them from the system.  A
  sample config is included in the readme.

- Implemented export csv for snippet_group.

- Added optional legends.

- Add option to show tables in collage view.

- Importing the simplejson module in a different way to please windows in
  combination with python 2.6.


1.2 (2010-08-16)
----------------

- Added a bit of test setup to make xml test reports possible (for integration
  with Hudson).  Similarly for coverage reports, also for Hudson.  Automatic
  code quality monitoring!

- Implemented snippet groups. Snippet groups group similar snippets in
  a collage.

- Removed site-specific breadcrumbs.

- Refactored collage view. One can now edit graphs in the collage
  view. The graph-only editor has been removed.

- Added an animation slider for showing map layers at specific points in
  time.  Only shown when there are workspace items that support it.

- Removed graph-properties that were stored in the session.

- Passing extra 'request' keyword argument to all adapter layer() methods.
  **Warning**:  This needs refactoring in all adapters.  Advance warning:
  we'll probably refactor the adapters to get the request in their
  ``__init__()`` method later on.


1.1 (2010-07-16)

  class for image replacement.


0.15 (2010-07-02)
-----------------

- Better empty height/width handling for images.

- Fixed graph display: no more overlap.

- Added global graph settings.


0.10 (2010-06-22)
-----------------

- More feedback (hourglass pointer and so).


0.9 (2010-06-18)
----------------

- Fixed wms.html's javascript code: long live jslint!

- Not emptying the temp workspace anymore: it was happening too often.  Now it
  isn't happening often enough, though.  Will be fixed later.

----------------

- Added early support for collages/snippets.

- Switched the custom attributes over to "data-xxxxx" attributes (those are
  valid html5).

- Added generic draggability of .workspace-acceptable items.


0.4 (2010-05-18)
----------------

- Collected the rijksdriehoek and google mercator proj4 strings in one
  location (coordinates.py).  Including handy conversion methods.

- Added views for showing and managing workspaces.

- Added workspaces and workspaceitems for showing map layers and de-coupling
  them with behind-the-scenes data.
