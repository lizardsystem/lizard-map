1.55 (2011-02-28)
-----------------

- Added coordinates.MapSettings. It makes life easier when reading
  from your django setting MAP_SETTINGS.

1.51 (2011-02-16)

-----------------

- Added more tests (test coverage now at 62%).

- Various UI and javascript fixes.

- Showing aggregation period data in the statistics table.

1.9 (2010-09-03)
----------------

- Use updated krw shapefiile.

- Use different open street map.


1.8 (2010-08-30)
----------------

- Bugfix for when no statistics are available.


1.7 (2010-08-27)
----------------

- Graph and collage popups now use the "regular" jquerytools popup instead of
  the OpenLayers in-the-map popup.  Visually cleaner, clearer and prettier.
  And easier to maintain and to get right.

- Various visual fixes.

- Deleting a workspace item also deletes the corresponding snippets.

- Added color pulldown for collage view settings (instead of requiring you to
  know the internal matplotlib color code names :-) )


1.6 (2010-08-26)
----------------

- Animation slider and name-hover are now also working in the default
  workspace view.

- Name hover is now placed just to the lower right of the cursor.  This way
  you can still click on the item you hovered above instead of your click
  being blocked sometimes by the hovering name.

- Added slightly more whitespace to the right of legend-less graphs: this
  prevents (most) labels from being cut off.


1.5 (2010-08-26)
----------------

- Added tooltips with name when hovering over clickable map items.

- Layout improvements for popups and tables.

- Added dateperiods: calculate periods for use in graphs.

- Added styling for popups.


1.4 (2010-08-23)
----------------

- WorkspaceCollageSnippetGroup's name was a TextField (=multiline) instead of
  a simple CharField.  Oracle stores a TextField as a "NCLOB" and has some
  restrictions on them (no index, no .distinct()).  Anyway, this blew up on
  an oracle-using installation.  Fixed now.

- Removed double value_aggregate() method from base adapter: the extra one
  raised a NotImplemented error and overshadowed the real method.


1.3 (2010-08-18)
----------------

- Requiring our dependencies that must be installed with system eggs.  We use
  the osc.recipe.sysegg in our own buildout to grab them from the system.  A
  sample config is included in the readme.

- Implemented export csv for snippet_group.

- Added optional legends.

- Add option to show tables in collage view.

- Importing the simplejson module in a different way to please windows in
  combination with python 2.6.


1.2 (2010-08-16)
----------------

- Added a bit of test setup to make xml test reports possible (for integration
  with Hudson).  Similarly for coverage reports, also for Hudson.  Automatic
  code quality monitoring!

- Implemented snippet groups. Snippet groups group similar snippets in
  a collage.

- Removed site-specific breadcrumbs.

- Refactored collage view. One can now edit graphs in the collage
  view. The graph-only editor has been removed.

- Added an animation slider for showing map layers at specific points in
  time.  Only shown when there are workspace items that support it.

- Removed graph-properties that were stored in the session.

- Passing extra 'request' keyword argument to all adapter layer() methods.
  **Warning**:  This needs refactoring in all adapters.  Advance warning:
  we'll probably refactor the adapters to get the request in their
  ``__init__()`` method later on.


1.1 (2010-07-16)

0.9 (2010-06-18)
----------------
