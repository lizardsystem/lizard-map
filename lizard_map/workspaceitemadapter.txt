Drawing wms layers
==================

WMS layer functions are generally defined in layers.py. One can add
his own in other apps. shapefile_layer is an example function.

    >>> from lizard_map.workspaceitemadapter import WorkspaceItemAdapterShapefile
    >>> workspaceitemadapter = WorkspaceItemAdapterShapefile()
    >>> layers, styles = workspaceitemadapter.layer()
