Using workspaces
----------------

Multiple workspaces are attached to a session. These workspaces are
used in several screens. We need a client to use this functionality.

    >>> from django.test.client import Client
    >>> c = Client()

We use the WorkspaceManager to find and create our workspaces:

    >>> from lizard_map.workspace import WorkspaceManager
    >>> mock_request = {}
    >>> workspace_manager = WorkspaceManager(mock_request)
