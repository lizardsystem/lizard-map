lizard-map
==========

Lizard-map provides basic map interaction for `Django
<http://www.djangoproject.com>`_ applications that use a `lizard-ui
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lizard-ui>`_ user interface.  We designed it at
`Nelen & Schuurmans <http://www.nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_ for our geographical
information websites (with water management information).

It provides:

- Openlayers (map javascript libary) map display and server-side map
  generation (mapnik's WMS functionality).

- A "workspace" interaction model: drag mappable items into a workspace and
  they'll get displayed.  The workspace is stored in the Django database.

- A "collage" attached to every workspace for storing selected info on map
  items (like graphs).

- An extention mechanism to plug more or less arbitrary map sources into the
  workspace so that they can be displayed, searched, etc.


Core concept: workspaces
------------------------

A *workspace item* is something that can be displayed on a map.  A *workspace*
is a collection of workspace items that is actually displayed.

Every session gets its own workspace.  (There is a possiblity of adding extra
workspaces, but that isn't used yet in one of our sites, so it isn't fully
thought-out yet).

A workspace item needs to know how to display itself, how to search for items
when you click on the map and more.  To get that to work for arbitrary map
sources, you need to configure an adapter.  The adapter has a ``layer()``
method for returning a mapnik layer, a ``search()`` method for searching and
so on.

- You register an adapter as a so-called "setuptools entrypoint" under a
  specfic name.

- When you add a workspace item, you pass in the adapter name and an optional
  snippet of json to configure the adapter.

The workspace item keeps track of this adapter and its configuragion and uses
it to generate maps, for searching, etc.


Collages
--------

A workspace item often results in multiple areas or points.  If you click on
such a point, you normally get a popup with extra information.  If you want to
compare a couple of those information "snippets", you can place them in your
workspace's *collage*.

Clicking the collage gives a popup with all the collected information popups
in that single popup.


Interaction
-----------

Included is quite some javascript for workspace interaction.  Potential
workspace items can be drag/dropped into a workspace to add them.  Workspace
items can be reordered.  You can drag them to the trash.


Dependencies
------------

Almost all dependencies are listed in our ``setup.py``, so they get pulled in
automatically.  Not all of them install as good as eggs, though.  You might be
better off installing them system-wide with your OS's own packaging system.

You can force buildout to use system-wide installed packages with the
`osc.recipe.sysegg <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/osc.recipe.sysegg>`_ recipe.
An example config::

  [buildout]
  ...
  parts =
      sysegg
      ...

  [sysegg]
  recipe = osc.recipe.sysegg
  force-sysegg = true
  eggs =
      PIL
      matplotlib
      simplejson
      pyproj


Development installation
------------------------

The first time, you'll have to run the "bootstrap" script to set up setuptools
and buildout::

    $> python bootstrap.py

And then run buildout to set everything up::

    $> bin/buildout

(On windows it is called ``bin\buildout.exe``).

You'll have to re-run buildout when you or someone else made a change in
``setup.py`` or ``buildout.cfg``.

The current package is installed as a "development package", so
changes in .py files are automatically available (just like with ``python
setup.py develop``).

If you want to use trunk checkouts of other packages (instead of released
versions), add them as an "svn external" in the ``local_checkouts/`` directory
and add them to the ``develop =`` list in buildout.cfg.

Tests can always be run with ``bin/test`` or ``bin\test.exe``.


External dependencies
---------------------

The dependencies for a full website that uses lizard-map are best expressed as
ubuntu/debian package dependencies: build-essential, python2.6-dev, apache2,
libjpeg-dev, python-imaging, python-matplotlib, python-mapnik, python-scipy,
libapache2-mod-wsgi, python-gdal, spatialite-bin, python-pysqlite2,
python-pyproj.


Site integration
----------------

The following steps has to be done in order to use the
lizard_map/workspace concepts.

- Install lizard-map somewhere. (Add 'lizard-map' in your setup.py:
  install_requires)

- Add 'lizard_map' to your settings.py: INSTALLED_APPS.

- Add 'django.core.context_processors.request' to your settings.py's
  ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``. Omitting this will not zoom in to your
  saved location when loading the page (= going to another app).

- Add an entry in your urls.py::

    (r'^map/', include('lizard_map.urls')),

- On your page, include the following parameters:

   - javascript_hover_handler (popup_click_handler)
   - javascript_click_handler (popup_hover_handler)
   - date_range_form
   - workspaces

Example view::

    from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
    from django.template import RequestContext

    from lizard_map.daterange import DateRangeForm
    from lizard_map.daterange import current_start_end_dates
    from lizard_map.workspace import WorkspaceManager


    def homepage(request,
                 javascript_click_handler='popup_click_handler',
                 javascript_hover_handler='popup_hover_handler',
                 template="lizard_shape/homepage.html"):
        """
        Main page for Shape.
        """

        workspace_manager = WorkspaceManager(request)
        workspaces = workspace_manager.load_or_create()
        date_range_form = DateRangeForm(
            current_start_end_dates(request, for_form=True))

        return render_to_response(
            template,
            {'javascript_hover_handler': javascript_hover_handler,
             'javascript_click_handler': javascript_click_handler,
             'date_range_form': date_range_form,
             'workspaces': workspaces},
            context_instance=RequestContext(request))


Example template::

    {% extends "lizard_map/wms.html" %}
    {% load workspaces %}

    {% block subtitle %} (page name) {% endblock %}

    {% block sidebar %}

<div id="iconbox" class="sidebarbox sidebarbox-stretched iconlist">
  <h2>Apps</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/address/" class="lizard-map-link">
          <img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}lizard_ui/app_icons/meetgegevens.png" />
          <div>App</div>
        </a>
      </li>
  </ul>
</div>

    {% for workspace in workspaces.user %}
      {% workspace workspace %}
    {% empty %}
    No workspace
    {% endfor %}

    {% endblock %}

- Add this view to your views.py:

    (r'^$', 'mapdemo.views.homepage'),

- Start testing by running syncdb, then start dev server.
